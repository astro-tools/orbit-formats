# Contributing to orbit-formats

Thanks for your interest. This page is the one place to learn the workflow.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astro-tools/orbit-formats.git
cd orbit-formats
uv sync --all-groups
```

This installs the package, its runtime dependencies, and the dev and docs groups.

## Branches and PRs

- One issue per branch. Branch names use a short prefix for type:
  - `feat/<slug>` — new capability, tied to a `type:feature` issue.
  - `fix/<slug>` — bug fix, tied to a `type:bug` issue.
  - `chore/<slug>` — infra / tooling / hygiene.
  - `docs/<slug>` — docs-only change.
- Open a PR against `main`. Put `Closes #<N>` in the PR description so the issue
  auto-closes on merge and the project board advances the card to Done.
- Squash-merge is the only merge method. The PR title becomes the squash commit
  subject — write it as a complete imperative sentence.

## Local checks before pushing

```bash
uv run pytest               # tests
uv run ruff check           # lint
uv run ruff format --check  # formatting
uv run mypy                 # types
```

CI re-runs all four on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

## Commit messages

Keep them short and imperative. One subject line, optional body.

Do not include AI or tool attribution trailers in commits, PR titles, PR descriptions,
or comments — see the repo-level convention.

## Scope discipline

orbit-formats is an I/O and conversion library: it reads, writes, and converts orbital
state and ephemeris formats, and warns whenever a conversion cannot preserve
information. It is deliberately not a propagator, an integrator, or a general
frame-transformation engine. Before opening a feature issue, check the charter and the
existing issues to make sure the work belongs here.

## Questions

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/astro-tools/discussions) rather than an
issue for open-ended questions, usage help, or brainstorming. The astro-tools org runs
a single shared discussions space — there is no per-repo discussions board.
